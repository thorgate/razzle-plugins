## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up razzle-plugins for local
development.

1.  Fork the razzle-plugins repo on GitHub.
2.  Clone your fork locally:

        $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/razzle-plugins.git

3.  Install dependencies

        $ yarn install
        $ yarn bootstrap

4.  Create a branch for local development:

        $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

    Now you can make your changes locally.

5.  When you're done making changes, check that your the tests pass.

        $ yarn test

6.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

        $ git add .
        $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
        $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7.  Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1.  The pull request should include tests.
2.  If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.

## Creating a new release

Once the changes have been published on the master branch and it is time to create a new
release you can do this following these steps.

1. Make sure your `origin` git remote points to the root repository.
2. Ensure your local working directory is clean and contains the latest changes from remote:
   - `git status --porcelain && git pull origin master`
3. Log in to npm using `npm login`
4. Then use `yarn run-publish` or `yarn run-publish:git` to create a new release
   - `run-publish`: publish packages that have changed since the last release
   - `run-publish:git`: explicitly publish packages tagged in the current commit
5. Once the script completes the updated versions should be available in npm
